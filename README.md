#### About
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

In this project I:
- have re-created a Flappy Bird game using [`pygame`](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) package 

- taught an AI to make artificial genomes using [`neat-python`](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package

- AI could learn how to play Flappy Birds in real time

#### Features
[main.py](https://github.com/CoolmixZero/flappy-bird-ai/main.py) - starts game and also an AI genomes generation, settings for neat-python in cfg-feedforward.txt 

[flappy_bird.py](https://github.com/CoolmixZero/flappy-bird-ai/flappy_bird.py) and [src](https://github.com/CoolmixZero/flappy-bird-ai/src) - code and folder with classes for Flappy Bird game.

#### Requirements
To install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/CoolmixZero/flappy-bird-ai/requirements.txt) you need to write this command in the terminal:
```shell
